<p> Reflection 1</p>
<p>After reading the opening chapter of Susan Sontag’s book On Photography, I began to think more critically about the power of taking photos. Sontag discusses how photography isn’t just about capturing what’s in front of you, it’s about shaping how we see and remember the world. That idea really stuck with me. When I take photos, I realize I have the power to capture a moment in time, but I also have the power to choose what is captured, how it's captured, what is seen, and how it's portrayed. It’s more than just an image, it's a way to tell a story and express ideas. I don't just get to capture reality, I get to capture how it's remembered, how it feels, and it gives viewers a lens into the way I see reality. 
Realizing this made me reflect on my own creative process and think about how I want to use photography and other visual tools in my work going forward. I want to be intentional about what I choose to show and how I show it. I want it to reflect my thoughts, feelings, and questions about the world around me. As I continue developing my skills and experimenting with new tools, I know I’ll keep growing as I continue to work on my projects and develop my artistic vision. 
As I work on each of the ten projects for this course, I will go forward viewing them as one larger body of work split into 10 parts.  I want to treat them as a body of work that grows over time. Each project can build off ideas or styles from the previous ones. Take those ideas and explore new ideas and messages that I may want to portray in my work. I want each project to have connections in tone, message, and visual style. That way, when I look back at all ten projects I can see how I have grown. 
Every project I create will communicate ideas, but it will also capture the world in the way I want it reflected. Photography and media art give me the tools to express not just what I see, but what I think and feel. 
By the end of the semester, I hope my ten projects show a journey not just of learning new tools but of becoming more confident in how I use visual media to express ideas. I’m excited to explore how photography, illustration, and even animation can help me represent the world as it is and how I see it through my eyes.
