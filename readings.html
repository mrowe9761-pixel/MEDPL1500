<p> Reflection 1</p>
<p>After reading the opening chapter of Susan Sontag’s book On Photography, I began to think more critically about the power of taking photos. Sontag discusses how photography isn’t just about capturing what’s in front of you, it’s about shaping how we see and remember the world. That idea really stuck with me. When I take photos, I realize I have the power to capture a moment in time, but I also have the power to choose what is captured, how it's captured, what is seen, and how it's portrayed. It’s more than just an image, it's a way to tell a story and express ideas. I don't just get to capture reality, I get to capture how it's remembered, how it feels, and it gives viewers a lens into the way I see reality. 
Realizing this made me reflect on my own creative process and think about how I want to use photography and other visual tools in my work going forward. I want to be intentional about what I choose to show and how I show it. I want it to reflect my thoughts, feelings, and questions about the world around me. As I continue developing my skills and experimenting with new tools, I know I’ll keep growing as I continue to work on my projects and develop my artistic vision. 
As I work on each of the ten projects for this course, I will go forward viewing them as one larger body of work split into 10 parts.  I want to treat them as a body of work that grows over time. Each project can build off ideas or styles from the previous ones. Take those ideas and explore new ideas and messages that I may want to portray in my work. I want each project to have connections in tone, message, and visual style. That way, when I look back at all ten projects I can see how I have grown. 
Every project I create will communicate ideas, but it will also capture the world in the way I want it reflected. Photography and media art give me the tools to express not just what I see, but what I think and feel. 
By the end of the semester, I hope my ten projects show a journey not just of learning new tools but of becoming more confident in how I use visual media to express ideas. I’m excited to explore how photography, illustration, and even animation can help me represent the world as it is and how I see it through my eyes.

  <p> Reflection on Nesrine Malik's "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" </p>
  <P>After reading Nesrine Malik’s ‘With AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster’ I realized the scary realities and impacts that AI has on this world and in the creative fields. The author describes ‘AI slop’ as silly pictures of cats, crazy landscapes, or weird images of celebrities. But the article shows how AI can be weaponized in politics, and dull our ability to use critical thinking. 
One of the strongest takeaways that I got from this article is that AI content doesn’t just blur reality it completely distorts it. Political propaganda has been around for centuries, but generative AI has made it accessible to everyone and allowed for political messages to spread faster. Anyone with basic knowledge on how to use a phone can now create entire scenarios where political opponents fail or harmful ideals are painted in a new light. The examples given in the article of the Trump AI fantasies, Studio Ghibli style deportation images, or Chinese AI mocking American workers demonstrate how this technology is already functioning as a harmful political tool across the globe. What makes it more dangerous is that AI content often is spread in social media channels that don't have a fact checking system, such as WhatsApp, where recipients are less likely to encounter corrections. 
For me, the most unsettling part of the argument is about disorientation. When real life tragedies like students being kidnapped or people burned alive appear alongside poorly generated AI memes, serious information and crises often get overlooked or are not taken seriously. We start to become desensitized to horrible news and look at atrocities like murder and genocides in the same way that we look at memes. Instead of action being taken, the content is an endless stream of mind numbing pictures. This makes me reflect deeply on my own experience of political news being shared on social media. Especially on social media platforms like Tik Tok where most videos are no longer than thirty seconds. For example, last week  there were political protests that broke out in Nepal and I was getting videos of burning buildings and violence mixed in with memes and current trends. These protests are still going on but the political situation isn't being talked about because people are so desensitized to political news due to short form content having a rise in popularity and in combination with AI. 
Reflecting on this article further, My view on Ai has changed completely. I used to be impressed by the creativity and accessibility of generative AI. After reading this article I realized that Ai is being used as a harmful tool in the political climate. I believe it also has a negative impact in creative fields because people don't take the time to think anymore; they just put a phrase into generative AI. I also worry about how it will reshape our reality in the future as it gets built into everyday life more and more. As more data gets pumped into Ai it will be very difficult to tell the difference between Ai generated images and real ones. The challenge for us is not just to detect AI content, but to go against it . Unless we learn to preserve our attention spans and critical thinking skills, we risk an even more dangerous political climate moving forward and the loss of all creative skills.
