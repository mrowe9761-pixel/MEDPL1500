  <h2>Eye Image</h2>

<p>For the chapter 7 illustrated environment assignment I chose an image of a living/home environment to alter. I chose an environment of a home/living area because I wanted to use color and other tools in illustrator to change the mood that I got from the image. Firstly I used image trace and traced the image so I was able to use the shapes from it. I then used the coloring tool to change the image into only three colors. I used deep blues to make a moody and sad feeling environment. Since in this assignment I was limited to only using three colors the image lacked depth that I wanted. So using the shape tools I used two rectangles and created a rug in the image to help create depth from the floor and furniture on it.
