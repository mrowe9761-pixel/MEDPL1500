  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For my first image, All images that I used were images that I took of singers at their concert with their stage designs. The background image is a cross, and I surrounded it with images of the celebrities. To me, this represents the idea of parasocial relationships between celebrities and their fans. Celebrities are often viewed as a god or an untouchable figure, and attending a concert can feel almost like a place of worship where fans gather to celebrate their favorite artist. This image made me reflect deeply on how, when I go to concerts or similar spaces, I am essentially going to see a stranger that I really know nothing about dance and sing on stage. Even though I have never actually met the artist, I am able to connect with them through their work. 
	For my second image I took an image of a beach and I created an extremely polluted environment. I first took an image of a beach and I placed an image of a garbage pile of sand. I then added images of sewer pipes and an industrial building in the skyline. I then placed a picture of earth from space on top of the image and used color blending tools to make it blend in. using the exposure color blending tool it gave the image this hazy effect with random rainbow splotches. The haziness that this effect added made me reflect on how the further we advance into technology the more we harm the environment and how it will become more difficult to deal with environmental issues. All images that I used for this collage were taken from the internet.
