  <h1>Homework 2</h1>

  <h2>Image 1</h2>
  <img src="images/images/homework2image01-2.jpg" width="80%">

  <p>
I chose this first image because I was able to capture an urban view that had some natural elements like some tree branches. I then added an image of a potted plant that I took. I wanted this to create constraints because the image is mainly composed of the urban landscape. Using Hue/Saturation tools I made the urban landscape look blue and almost washed out. I wanted this to bring a sense like something was missing. I then used exposure and Hue/saturation tools to make the image of the potted plant appear more colorful.

  <h2>Image 2</h2>

<p>For the second image I created I used an image that had a really long shutter speed. This created a blurred effect of the urban landscape that I captured. Then using vibrance, color balance, postorize, and gradient map tools. I made the image black and white creating an eery feeling. I then used a picture of a tree that I took and edited using the invert and hue and saturation tools. This made the image very colorful. I then placed this image on top of the black and white image which created contrast.
